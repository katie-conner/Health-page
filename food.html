            <h2>New studies suggest there is no need to reduce consumption of red and processed meat</h2>
            <img src="carne.jpg" width="500">
            <p>2nd October 2019</p>

            <p>A new set of reviews published yesterday suggests that there is no need for adults who eat red or processed meat to cut down. The guidelines, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine are authored by the Nutritional Recommendations (NutriRECS) consortium in the US and the reviews have been conducted using a methodology set out by the consortium. This includes performing a systematic review and using GRADE* criteria to rate the certainty of evidence.</p>

            <p>Systematic reviews were performed on cardio-metabolic and cancer outcomes and on all-cause mortality from both cohort and randomized controlled trials. A further study was also carried out on people’s health-related values and preferences in relation to red and processed meat. Issues of potential environmental impact were outside the scope of the guidelines.</p>

            <p>Generally the reviews found the quality of the evidence to be low and, for the outcomes included, the effect sizes relatively small or insignificant and the consortium suggested that for both red and processed meats that adults could continue to consume these at current levels.</p>

            <p>However, this conclusion has been challenged by health bodies including Public Health England, Cancer Research UK and the World Cancer Research Fund. Whilst the magnitude of the increased risks related to red and processed meat consumption are small, when considered across a population they could potentially affect a lot of people. For example, one finding was that a decrease of 3 servings of red or processed meat per week could result in between 1-12 fewer cases of type 2 diabetes per 1000 people. Applying this to a population of millions of people, this could potentially be equivalent to hundreds of thousands fewer cases.</p>

            <p>Given that diet-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes develop over decades and that risk is affected by many different factors it is notoriously difficult to design studies that can produce strong evidence for relationships between specific foods or diets and risk of ill health. Observational studies, where populations are followed over time, cannot show cause and effect, only associations, and are subject to confounding by factors other than those in question. Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard in medical research but can be impractical or even impossible to conduct in the context of diet and disease where it can be difficult to enforce a strictly controlled diet on people for any period of time or to conduct a study over the years or even decades needed to monitor disease outcomes.</p>

            <p>In this context, dietary guidance must be given using the best available evidence to provide the best possible outcomes for the population as a whole.</p>

            <p>While the risks found in the studies that have hit the headlines today may be small, on balance, it’s still sensible to follow existing guidance from Government, which suggests that adults who eat more than 90g of red and processed meat a day should reduce their intake to 70g a day. In its recommendations, the World Cancer Research Fund advises that there is no need to completely avoid eating meat but that people should eat no more than 300-500g (cooked weight) of red meat a week, in the context of a healthy, balanced diet. Characteristics of dietary patterns associated with health benefit include an emphasis on plant-based foods such as fruits and vegetables and wholegrains, and unsaturated fats and oils, as well as a variety of protein foods, including nuts and pulses, seafood, eggs, lean meats and poultry and lower-fat dairy products.</p>


            <h2>Poor diets associated with 11 million deaths worldwide according to the Lancet Global Burden of Disease Study</h2>
            <img src="frutas.jpg" width="500">
            <p>4th April 2019</p>

            <p>This study, published in the Lancet today, has hit the headlines with news that globally, 1 in 5 deaths (11 million in total) in 2017 were associated with poor diet. Cardiovascular disease was by far the biggest cause of death, linked to 10 million deaths in the study. Interestingly the study found that overall, the lack of healthy foods and nutrients seemed to be more important in affecting disease risk than an excess of unhealthy ones.</p>
            <p>This study looked at dietary intakes across 195 countries and quantified the burden of disease (population attributable fraction) that could be attributed to deaths related to cardiovascular disease, cancer or type 2 diabetes, as well as the impact of diet on ill health (as disability-adjusted life-years or DALYs).</p>
            <p>Using data collated within each of the countries included, the study looked at 15 different aspects of the diet:</p>
            <p>Low intakes of:</p>
            <p>•	Fruit, vegetables, legumes, wholegrains, nuts and seeds, milk, fibre, calcium, long chain omega 3s from seafood, and polyunsaturated fats.</p>
            <p>High intakes of:</p>
            <p>•	Red meat, processed meat, sugar-sweetened drinks, trans fats and sodium.</p>
            <p>There were varying levels of data available for each of these from the countries included, in particular for sodium (based on 24 hour urinary sodium excretion), which was only available in about 1 in 4 of the countries.</p>
            <p>For each of the factors included, the optimal intake was calculated based on a meta-analysis previously carried out by Global Burden of Disease researchers. These figures differ from current public health advice in the UK, for example the total suggested for fruit, vegetables and legumes was 670g per day (compared to 400g or more that forms the basis of the UK 5 A DAY recommendation), the level suggested for fibre was 24g (as compared to 30g/day for adults in the UK) and for sodium, the equivalent as salt used was 7.5g/d (compared to 6g/day for adults in the UK).</p>
            <p>Globally the study found that intakes of all the factors measured were ‘non-optimal’, that is below the optimum for the ‘healthier’ dietary attributes and above the optimum for the ‘unhealthier’ ones. No one country managed to reach the optimal level for all attributes and no one attribute was optimal across all countries.</p>
            <p>Overall the study found that the largest number of diet-related deaths were associated with eating too much sodium and not enough wholegrains or fruits (the relative importance of the different factors varied by region - in Western Europe the factor associated with the greatest number of deaths was low wholegrain intake, followed by low intake of nuts and seeds and high sodium intakes). Across all 15 dietary attributes, more deaths were associated with not eating enough ‘healthy’ foods or nutrients than eating too much of those foods or nutrients classed in the study as ‘unhealthy’.</p>
            <p>The countries with the lowest rates of diet-related death were Israel, followed by France, Spain and Japan. The UK was ranked 23rd, followed by Ireland and Sweden who were 24th and 25th respectively. The US was ranked 43rd, India 118th and China 140th. The country with the highest diet-related disease risk according to this study was Uzbekistan, which had ten times more diet-related deaths than in Israel. The association between of different nutrients and diet-related deaths varied by country with high sodium intakes being the biggest contributor in China and Japan, low wholegrain intakes the biggest contributor in the US, Russia and India and low fruit intakes the biggest contributor in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In an associated comment piece in the Lancet, the relative costs of fruits and vegetables across the globe were highlighted with three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit accounting for 52% of household income in low income countries compared to only 2% of income in high income countries, representing a significant barrier to increasing intakes in low income countries.</p>
            <p>The study is based on observational data and, inevitably with 195 countries included there were variations in how the data were collected.  15 dietary attributes were selected for inclusion in the study – some that are of interest to health such as saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and free sugars across the diet (not just those in drinks) were not included in the analysis. The study also did not take into account lifestyle factors, such as smoking, obesity and physical activity, that can have a significant impact on the risk of the disease outcomes used in the study.</p>
            <p>Overall the finding that it was the lack of healthy foods over and above the excess of unhealthy ones that had the greatest impact on disease risk is interesting and perhaps points to the importance of giving positive healthy eating messages about the foods we should eat more of and not just those we need to cut back on.</p>
