        <p>Make sure you put time aside for yourself to eat well. Minimising junk and consuming a healthy balance of protein, nutritious vegetables and fruit will help to maintain good health, prevent future health issues and significantly boost your energy and mood.

        </p>

        <p2>Poor diet is associated with 11 million deaths worldwide.
        </p2>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>The largest number of diet-related deaths were associated with eating too much sodium and not enough wholegrains or fruits (the relative importance of the different factors varied by region - in Western Europe the factor associated with the greatest number of deaths was low wholegrain intake, followed by low intake of nuts and seeds and high sodium intakes). Across all 15 dietary attributes, more deaths were associated with not eating enough ‘healthy’ foods or nutrients than eating too much of those foods or nutrients classed in the study as ‘unhealthy’.

        <p>Thinking of going vegan for 2019, or including more vegan options to your repertoire? Switching to a vegan diet can be daunting, but to ease the transition, here are some accessible substitutes.

        </p>

  <br>

        <h2>1.Jackfruit</h2>

        <p>Versatile and surprisingly cheap, jackfruit is a non-processed ingredient that you’ll often find in cans, meaning you can stock up in the cupboard. It makes a great replacement for chicken, perhaps in a stir-fry, but can also be prepared to resemble tuna.

        </p>



        <br>

        <h2>2.Aquafaba</h2>

        <p>The water from a can of chickpeas is a superb substitute for egg white. It can used to make meringues, mousses and lots of bakes like macarons, sponges and brownies. Add chickpea water to dairy-free buttercream and you’ll get a much lighter frosting. It can even be a central ingredient in dairy free batter and sauces like mayonnaise. You may find it useful in cocktails, too – a vegan can have a whisky sour after all!

        </p>



        <br>

        <h2>3.Seitan</h2>

        <p>Often called vital wheat gluten, seitan is made from wheat protein. There are loads of off-the-shelf products available, but you could also make your own. With seasonings, you can flavour a dry mix made with wheat gluten flour, then create a wet mix using alternative milk, tofu and any flavourings you like (depending on your desired outcome). Mix the two together into a dough and knead well.

        </p>

        <p>If you’re craving fast food, you can fry it in chunks with seasoned batter for a fried chicken substitute. For a healthier alternative, it can be roasted, grilled or oven cooked. It’s a good substitute for duck, beef, bacon and sausage, and can be paired with most cuisines, but it seems to be most popular with Asian food, having originated in China where it’s been used as a source of protein for centuries.

        </p>



        <br>

        <h2>4.Milk Substitutes</h2>

        <p>Popular non-dairy milks include oat, hazelnut, cashew, soy, almond and hemp. It’s also easy to make your own by soaking raw nuts, blending with water and straining. Alternative milks not only are great subs for drinks but also can be used in many recipes for cooking and baking.

        </p>



        <br>

        <h2>5.Alternative Cheeses</h2>

        <p>It's tricky to replicate the real deal, but alternative cheeses are really improving. Now, most supermarkets have their own ranges alongside various other brands, so there’s plenty to try. They’re made using a variety of ingredients, including coconuts, aquafaba, nuts and solidified vegetable oil. It’s best to opt for one fortified with vitamin B12 and calcium.

        </p>

        <p>A number of cheese substitutes are available, from mozzarella-style to cheddar and cream cheese. Recently, there are quite a few ‘artisan’ vegan cheese brands around, too. Lastly, as a good substitute for parmesan, try using dried nutritional yeast flakes. Not only is it a great source of B12 and other B vitamins, but it has a savoury flavour that pairs well with pasta and salads.

        </p>



        <br>

        <h2>6.Alternative Creams and Yogurts</h2>

        <p>Similarly to alternative milks, there’s an array of plant-based yogurts – perfect for adding to fruits, cereals, or just having on their own as a snack. They can be used for baking and cooking, too

        </p>

        <p>Similarly to other alternative dairy-free products, they’re fortified with vitamins but also filled with probiotic bacteria – meaning vegans can get some of the same health benefits as ordinary, dairy yogurt.

        </p>



        <br>

        <h2>7.Cheat or Mock Meats</h2>

        <p>In place of processed foods like chicken nuggets, burgers, fish fingers, sausages and hotdogs, there are a number of options for any fast food you might miss.All major supermarkets have their own ranges in addition to big brands, and new, smaller start-up companies are contributing, too.

        </p>





        <br>

        <h2>8.Tofu and Tempeh</h2>

        <p>Made from soybeans, tofu is a less-processed substitute for meat as it’s a complete protein. The firm variety is best for cooking in savoury dishes, and you can use the softer types for things like tofu scramble in place of egg, or add to puddings and bakes.

        </p>

        <p>Tempeh is made with fermented soybeans and is firmer in texture. It’s a great substitute for protein in Asian recipes, but also really good as 'bacon' if you thinly slice and fry it. Both tofu and tempeh are great vehicles for flavour, so work well in lots of dishes.

        </p>



        <br>

        <h2>9.Spreads and Fats</h2>

        <p>There are plenty of different dairy-free butter brands out there, from supermarket’s own to many other large and small brands. There is a Danish brand called Naturli which has a lovely butter-like salty taste.

        </p>



        <br>

        <h2>10.Whole Egg Substitutes</h2>

        <p>Powdered egg substitutes used to be found in more specific health stores, but a recent rise in popularity means you can easily track them down in supermarkets now, too. Some obvious uses include bakes and breakfast meals.
